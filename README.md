[@shijingbot](https://twitter.com/shijingbot) doesn't do very much. Well it makes me laugh, so I am very happy with it.

The idea behind the bot is simple. The bot tweets lines from the classical Chinese Book of Songs - an ancient anthology of poems compiled by Confucius - followed by Google's (always-nonsense) interpretation of the poems.

The code is even simpler. I used twython for the bot, random to randomize the lines, and TextBlob to do the translation - since Google Translate isn't actually free. The data was taken from a website online and I put everything into an excel sheet myself.

Then I uploaded everything to my server - and let the bot do its thing!
